# Employee Management System

This project is an employee management system that allows business owners to view and manage their company's departments, roles, and employees. The system runs on a command line interface (CLI) and uses the Node.js runtime environment with the Inquirer and console.table libraries.

As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## Installation

To use the employee management system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory
Run npm install to install all dependencies
Open the server.js file and update the database connection parameters to match your own MySQL database configuration.
Run node server.js to start the application
Usage
Upon launching the application, users will be presented with a main menu that allows them to select from several options, including:

View all departments
View all roles
View all employees
Add a department
Add a role
Add an employee
Update an employee role
Exit
Users can navigate the menu using the arrow keys and press enter to select an option. Depending on the selected option, the user will be able to view or manage the corresponding data in the database.

## Collaboration

This project was built using Node.js, Inquirer.js, and console.table.js.
